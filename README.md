# EE5907 Pattern Recognition CA1 Documentation
This file contains the instructions to run the Matlab code, all the code are places in folder named as "Source File". Details of how to run the code can be found in this README.md documentation. 
A more user friendly version of README can be found in github: 
https://github.com/S10143806H/Pattern_Recognition_CA1

## How to build the code?
Since project data ```spamData.mat``` is not included in ```Source Code``` folder, 
```spamData.mat``` can be found in LumiNUS EE5907 Folder. 
After importing the project data to ```Source Code``` folder, add the whole path to Matlab. Then the running environment is settled and codes are ready for running.
